# What it is

A set of scripts demonstrating how to upload a Redis dump file to a remote
(non-Redis) server

# Why It Exists

I initially began writing this for a Tutorial on how to copy Redis dumps to remote locations when I realized it would be more useful to make a utility and write the tutorial on the utility. The initial idea was to write it for Python and Go, and since I am learning Go I figured I'd continue it in both languages.

# How to Use it

Coming soon ...
